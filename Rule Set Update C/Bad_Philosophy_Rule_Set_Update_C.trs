What's up! It's the rule set update episode of Bad Philosophy.
<Sync time="4.043"/>
This is rule set update

C
<Who nb="2"/>
C?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="6.413" endTime="7.715">
<Sync time="6.413"/>
Third time we've done something like this
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="7.715" endTime="22.267">
<Sync time="7.715"/>
Third time we've done this, so we will get rule set
<Sync time="10.125"/>
D out of this
<Sync time="12.23"/>
episode. 
<Sync time="13.487"/>
So, we're gunna actually start out a little bit differently. We have 
<Sync time="16.576"/>
a few bits of audience feedback
<Sync time="19.01"/>
that we'd like to uh... 
<Sync time="20.102"/>
Y'all have been commenting more than
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="22.267" endTime="23.525">
<Sync time="22.267"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
typical,
<Who nb="2"/>
usual.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="23.525" endTime="25.693">
<Sync time="23.525"/>
I guess we are doing a good job?
<Sync time="25.092"/>
[laughs]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="25.693" endTime="26.209">
<Sync time="25.693"/>
Maybe...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="26.209" endTime="28.579">
<Sync time="26.209"/>
Or at least we are touching buttons that make people want to talk to us.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="28.579" endTime="38.391">
<Sync time="28.579"/>
Which is... Which is always a good thing.
<Sync time="30.104"/>
Um... So we would like to respond first to 
<Sync time="33.608"/>
um... Vince Tennant and uh... I guess if
<Sync time="36.431"/>
[unintellagable] read the whole comment on here 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="38.391" endTime="38.677">
<Sync time="38.391"/>
Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="38.677" endTime="41.28">
<Sync time="38.677"/>
and uh... go for it... Um... So, Vince says
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="41.28" endTime="88.202">
<Sync time="41.28"/>
"Hey guys! Loved the most recent pod about Stephen and his signing videos,
<Sync time="44.536"/>
you asked to be called out so:
<Sync time="46.72"/>
Do you think your use of quote listen and quote
<Sync time="50.019"/>
hear is inapproperate based on the conversation you just had?
<Sync time="53.357"/>
go back and note when listen and hear or their derivitaves are used
<Sync time="56.882"/>
um... and you are rarely meaning the decyphering of sound waves
<Sync time="60.551"/>
in our ears, rather you are using 
<Sync time="62.599"/>
them in place of understand or something close.
<Sync time="65.804"/>
For instance, if you apologize about it on your next pod,
<Sync time="69.454"/>
were you quote listening to me? Did you quote
<Sync time="72.437"/>
hear my concerns? No. The idea was 
<Sync time="74.748"/>
communicated through text and mutual concepts.
<Sync time="76.595"/>
In essance you were conflating communication with
<Sync time="79.051"/>
speech and hearing,
<Sync time="80.308"/>
continuing the disenfranchisement of the deaf community.
<Sync time="82.886"/>
Hmmm...
<Sync time="83.535"/>
Just a thought about the consete and power of hearing culture.
<Sync time="86.294"/>
Would be thrilled to read a response from you."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="88.202" endTime="89.846">
<Sync time="88.202"/>
So, Kevin you replied:
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="89.846" endTime="98.349">
<Sync time="89.846"/>
Um... I don't remember what I said,
<Sync time="91.712"/>
but I'll say the same thing just verbally
<Sync time="93.093"/>
Um...
<Sync time="93.662"/>
No, I think... I think this is an important thing to talk about.
<Sync time="96.867"/>
I appreciate Vince for bringing it up.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="98.349" endTime="98.735">
<Sync time="98.349"/>
Um hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="98.735" endTime="121.397">
<Sync time="98.735"/>
Um... It... It is worth noting, I actually am talking about it here as opposed to when I
<Sync time="102.447"/>
replied to him when I might say I am talking about it
<Sync time="104.379"/>
Um...
<Sync time="104.967"/>
No, but this opens up a really interesting can of worms.
<Sync time="107.705"/>
Um... In terms of what we talk about
<Sync time="110.605"/>
and we talked about on our last episode how...
<Sync time="113.0"/>
how language is culture.
<Sync time="114.4"/>
Um...
<Sync time="115.619"/>
And our language, that is to say the English language
<Sync time="118.663"/>
tends to privildge the hearing over the Deaf.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="121.397" endTime="122.032">
<Sync time="121.397"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="122.032" endTime="131.787">
<Sync time="122.032"/>
Um... Which we definately touched on at least.
<Sync time="124.359"/>
Uh, didn't necessarily acknowldge it in terms of using like
<Sync time="126.818"/>
terms like 'Do you hear me?'
<Sync time="128.319"/>
'Do you understand me?'
<Sync time="129.313"/>
as interchangable, or um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="131.787" endTime="133.005">
<Sync time="131.787"/>
'Do you see what I am saying?'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="133.005" endTime="135.378">
<Sync time="133.005"/>
Yes, which totally privildges the sighted community.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="135.378" endTime="135.743">
<Sync time="135.378"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="135.743" endTime="144.829">
<Sync time="135.743"/>
Like and...
<Sync time="137.791"/>
So...
<Sync time="139.618"/>
I think... I think this speeks to
<Sync time="142.01"/>
how... how incedious these sorts of things can be.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="144.829" endTime="145.438">
<Sync time="144.829"/>
Yes
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="145.438" endTime="161.942">
<Sync time="145.438"/>
Um... And how deeply ingrained they can be.
<Sync time="148.6"/>
Um... You know the...
<Sync time="151.499"/>
The use of Mr. Miss. or Mrs.
<Sync time="154.601"/>
is one of those thing that
<Sync time="156.75"/>
is everywhere. Um... You know. You can't get an
<Sync time="159.407"/>
Apple ID with out picking one of those titles
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="161.942" endTime="162.59">
<Sync time="161.942"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="162.59" endTime="171.899">
<Sync time="162.59"/>
Um...
<Sync time="164.212"/>
Which privildegs a lot of different things, and talks about heteronormitivity
<Sync time="168.044"/>
and these structures of gender that are in
<Sync time="170.194"/>
play throughout our entire society
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="171.899" endTime="172.383">
<Sync time="171.899"/>
Um, hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="172.383" endTime="192.662">
<Sync time="172.383"/>
Um...
<Sync time="173.763"/>
And I appreciate Vince pointing these out to us, and I think I said as much
<Sync time="176.317"/>
because... Um... It needs to be 
<Sync time="180.272"/>
recoginized as often as it can.
<Sync time="182.138"/>
And it's not necessarily something, like I don't...
<Sync time="185.342"/>
I would like to be aware enough
<Sync time="187.085"/>
to never use that
<Sync time="188.342"/>
term listen again
<Sync time="189.804"/>
Um... But... in that way, but I don't think that's going to happen
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="192.662" endTime="193.251">
<Sync time="192.662"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="193.251" endTime="204.042">
<Sync time="193.251"/>
Um... And... And I think being aware of it, and understanding
<Sync time="196.316"/>
the implications of it is and important, very important first step.
<Sync time="199.541"/>
Um... It's also somewhat privildged of me to be able to make that distinction,
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="204.042" endTime="205.543">
<Sync time="204.042"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
and to make that choice
<Who nb="2"/>
Sure...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="205.543" endTime="206.275">
<Sync time="205.543"/>
Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="206.275" endTime="219.799">
<Sync time="206.275"/>
One of the... the interisting things along
<Sync time="208.222"/>
this line that the Deaf culture has done is
<Sync time="211.182"/>
use a lot of um...
<Sync time="213.757"/>
sight, kind of like 
<Sync time="215.623"/>
doing that intensionally. Replacing 
<Sync time="217.853"/>
you know, 'I hear you' with 'I see you'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="219.799" endTime="220.165">
<Sync time="219.799"/>
Um, hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="220.165" endTime="224.606">
<Sync time="220.165"/>
Uh, and in stead of the 'Earth' it's the 'Eyerth'
<Sync time="223.411"/>
so you have E-Y-E-
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="224.606" endTime="225.276">
<Sync time="224.606"/>
Ahhh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="225.276" endTime="226.838">
<Sync time="225.276"/>
R-T-H
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="226.838" endTime="227.833">
<Sync time="226.838"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
stuff like that
<Who nb="2"/>
Sure... Sure...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="227.833" endTime="228.685">
<Sync time="227.833"/>
You have
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="228.685" endTime="229.983">
<Sync time="228.685"/>
Instead of the EARth
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="229.983" endTime="230.653">
<Sync time="229.983"/>
Right...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="230.653" endTime="230.937">
<Sync time="230.653"/>
Yeah...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="230.937" endTime="240.589">
<Sync time="230.937"/>
So... so to sort of 
<Sync time="232.6"/>
to raise 
<Sync time="233.858"/>
awareness of those of how those...
<Sync time="236.777"/>
those un... unseen or unheard 
<Sync time="239.595"/>
useses of language
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="240.589" endTime="241.076">
<Sync time="240.589"/>
Um, hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="241.076" endTime="244.706">
<Sync time="241.076"/>
Um... do shape our thoughts about these issues.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="244.706" endTime="251.275">
<Sync time="244.706"/>
Simmilar... Simmilar to um...
<Sync time="246.774"/>
although some people would find it controversal for some reason, you know, the use of 'herstory'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="251.275" endTime="252.797">
<Sync time="251.275"/>
Right... Right...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="252.797" endTime="262.897">
<Sync time="252.797"/>
As sort of this reawareness situation
<Sync time="256.183"/>
Um... and so I...
<Sync time="258.273"/>
I thank you Vince for... for
<Sync time="260.22"/>
following up and calling us out [chuckles].
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="262.897" endTime="282.468">
<Sync time="262.897"/>
Although I... I [chuckles]
<Sync time="265.028"/>
You bring that up, one of...
<Sync time="266.893"/>
in one of the responses to my essay
<Sync time="269.247"/>
from uhm...
<Sync time="270.829"/>
a fan on Pateron
<Sync time="273.019"/>
she...
<Sync time="274.843"/>
gave a very... very long and well thought out response about
<Sync time="278.129"/>
the use of social justice...
<Sync time="280.42"/>
the use of language in social justice movements,
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="282.468" endTime="282.874">
<Sync time="282.468"/>
Uh huh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="282.874" endTime="306.043">
<Sync time="282.874"/>
and was very against it, even as 
<Sync time="285.369"/>
a feminist using the term 'herstory'.
<Sync time="287.216"/>
She felt that crossed like some line
<Sync time="289.162"/>

<Sync time="289.69"/>

<Sync time="290.645"/>
There's a point to where your
<Sync time="292.571"/>
intentional modification of the linguistic
<Sync time="295.026"/>
norms becomes
<Sync time="296.59"/>
pedantic, or
<Sync time="298.011"/>
like... impractical.
<Sync time="299.959"/>
Right? Or it draws attention to itself
<Sync time="302.189"/>
in a way that's... that's not
<Sync time="303.913"/>
that doesn't benifit your movement
<Sync time="305.657"/>
[chuckles]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="306.043" endTime="310.909">
<Sync time="306.043"/>
And that's... that's something that is... that has long been
<Sync time="309.064"/>
a... a point of contention.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="310.909" endTime="311.497">
<Sync time="310.909"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="311.497" endTime="325.94">
<Sync time="311.497"/>
And I think we gotta always fall back on the complexities.
<Sync time="314.115"/>
You know? This is a complex subject, and one right answer is not the right answer for everybody.
<Sync time="317.421"/>
But, it's the same... it's the same way
<Sync time="319.896"/>
I think in certain ways
<Sync time="321.416"/>
that I've
<Sync time="322.086"/>
I do my absolute best to call this
<Sync time="324.195"/>
streat here in Austin 'guatelupe' [stresses ending ay sound] [TODO: check spelling]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="325.94" endTime="326.631">
<Sync time="325.94"/>
Right...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="326.631" endTime="330.242">
<Sync time="326.631"/>
Um... Because
<Sync time="329.188"/>
there's... there's...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="330.242" endTime="331.036">
<Sync time="330.242"/>
Instead of...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="331.036" endTime="2127.558">
<Sync time="331.036"/>
Instead of 'guatelupe' [no ay sound]. Which as any Austin native
<Sync time="333.309"/>
will tell you how that's pronounced.
<Sync time="334.953"/>
And... And it's like well
<Sync time="337.185"/>
[unintellagable] no that's not how it's pronounced... 'Well it is in Austin'
<Sync time="340.163"/>
And it's like 'Well it is when you're white'
<Sync time="342.014"/>
