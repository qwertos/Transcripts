What's up! It's the rule set update episode of Bad Philosophy.
<Sync time="4.043"/>
This is rule set update

<Who nb="1"/>
C
<Who nb="2"/>
C?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="6.413" endTime="7.715">
<Sync time="6.413"/>
Third time we've done something like this
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="7.715" endTime="22.267">
<Sync time="7.715"/>
Third time we've done this, so we will get rule set
<Sync time="10.125"/>
D out of this
<Sync time="12.23"/>
episode. 
<Sync time="13.487"/>
So, we're gunna actually start out a little bit differently. We have 
<Sync time="16.576"/>
a few bits of audience feedback
<Sync time="19.01"/>
that we'd like to uh... 
<Sync time="20.102"/>
Y'all have been commenting more than
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="22.267" endTime="23.525">
<Sync time="22.267"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
typical,
<Who nb="2"/>
usual.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="23.525" endTime="25.693">
<Sync time="23.525"/>
I guess we are doing a good job?
<Sync time="25.092"/>
[laughs]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="25.693" endTime="26.209">
<Sync time="25.693"/>
Maybe...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="26.209" endTime="28.579">
<Sync time="26.209"/>
Or at least we are touching buttons that make people want to talk to us.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="28.579" endTime="38.391">
<Sync time="28.579"/>
Which is... Which is always a good thing.
<Sync time="30.104"/>
Um... So we would like to respond first to 
<Sync time="33.608"/>
um... Vince Tennant and uh... I guess if
<Sync time="36.431"/>
[unintellagable] read the whole comment on here 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="38.391" endTime="38.677">
<Sync time="38.391"/>
Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="38.677" endTime="41.28">
<Sync time="38.677"/>
and uh... go for it... Um... So, Vince says

<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="41.28" endTime="88.202">
<Sync time="41.28"/>
"Hey guys! Loved the most recent pod about Stephen and his signing videos,
<Sync time="44.536"/>
you asked to be called out so:
<Sync time="46.72"/>
Do you think your use of quote listen and quote
<Sync time="50.019"/>
hear is inapproperate based on the conversation you just had?
<Sync time="53.357"/>
go back and note when listen and hear or their derivitaves are used
<Sync time="56.882"/>
um... and you are rarely meaning the decyphering of sound waves
<Sync time="60.551"/>
in our ears, rather you are using 
<Sync time="62.599"/>
them in place of understand or something close.
<Sync time="65.804"/>
For instance, if you apologize about it on your next pod,
<Sync time="69.454"/>
were you quote listening to me? Did you quote
<Sync time="72.437"/>
hear my concerns? No. The idea was 
<Sync time="74.748"/>
communicated through text and mutual concepts.
<Sync time="76.595"/>
In essance you were conflating communication with
<Sync time="79.051"/>
speech and hearing,
<Sync time="80.308"/>
continuing the disenfranchisement of the deaf community.
<Sync time="82.886"/>
Hmmm...
<Sync time="83.535"/>
Just a thought about the consete and power of hearing culture.
<Sync time="86.294"/>
Would be thrilled to read a response from you."
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="88.202" endTime="89.846">
<Sync time="88.202"/>
So, Kevin you replied:
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="89.846" endTime="98.349">
<Sync time="89.846"/>
Um... I don't remember what I said,
<Sync time="91.712"/>
but I'll say the same thing just verbally
<Sync time="93.093"/>
Um...
<Sync time="93.662"/>
No, I think... I think this is an important thing to talk about.
<Sync time="96.867"/>
I appreciate Vince for bringing it up.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="98.349" endTime="98.735">
<Sync time="98.349"/>
Um hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="98.735" endTime="121.397">
<Sync time="98.735"/>
Um... It... It is worth noting, I actually am talking about it here as opposed to when I
<Sync time="102.447"/>
replied to him when I might say I am talking about it
<Sync time="104.379"/>
Um...
<Sync time="104.967"/>
No, but this opens up a really interesting can of worms.
<Sync time="107.705"/>
Um... In terms of what we talk about
<Sync time="110.605"/>
and we talked about on our last episode how...
<Sync time="113.0"/>
how language is culture.
<Sync time="114.4"/>
Um...
<Sync time="115.619"/>
And our language, that is to say the English language
<Sync time="118.663"/>
tends to privildge the hearing over the Deaf.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="121.397" endTime="122.032">
<Sync time="121.397"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="122.032" endTime="131.787">
<Sync time="122.032"/>
Um... Which we definately touched on at least.
<Sync time="124.359"/>
Uh, didn't necessarily acknowldge it in terms of using like
<Sync time="126.818"/>
terms like 'Do you hear me?'
<Sync time="128.319"/>
'Do you understand me?'
<Sync time="129.313"/>
as interchangable, or um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="131.787" endTime="133.005">
<Sync time="131.787"/>
'Do you see what I am saying?'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="133.005" endTime="135.378">
<Sync time="133.005"/>
Yes, which totally privildges the sighted community.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="135.378" endTime="135.743">
<Sync time="135.378"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="135.743" endTime="144.829">
<Sync time="135.743"/>
Like and...
<Sync time="137.791"/>
So...
<Sync time="139.618"/>
I think... I think this speeks to
<Sync time="142.01"/>
how... how incedious these sorts of things can be.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="144.829" endTime="145.438">
<Sync time="144.829"/>
Yes
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="145.438" endTime="161.942">
<Sync time="145.438"/>
Um... And how deeply ingrained they can be.
<Sync time="148.6"/>
Um... You know the...
<Sync time="151.499"/>
The use of Mr. Miss. or Mrs.
<Sync time="154.601"/>
is one of those thing that
<Sync time="156.75"/>
is everywhere. Um... You know. You can't get an
<Sync time="159.407"/>
Apple ID with out picking one of those titles
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="161.942" endTime="162.59">
<Sync time="161.942"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="162.59" endTime="171.899">
<Sync time="162.59"/>
Um...
<Sync time="164.212"/>
Which privildegs a lot of different things, and talks about heteronormitivity
<Sync time="168.044"/>
and these structures of gender that are in
<Sync time="170.194"/>
play throughout our entire society
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="171.899" endTime="172.383">
<Sync time="171.899"/>
Um, hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="172.383" endTime="192.662">
<Sync time="172.383"/>
Um...
<Sync time="173.763"/>
And I appreciate Vince pointing these out to us, and I think I said as much
<Sync time="176.317"/>
because... Um... It needs to be 
<Sync time="180.272"/>
recoginized as often as it can.
<Sync time="182.138"/>
And it's not necessarily something, like I don't...
<Sync time="185.342"/>
I would like to be aware enough
<Sync time="187.085"/>
to never use that
<Sync time="188.342"/>
term listen again
<Sync time="189.804"/>
Um... But... in that way, but I don't think that's going to happen
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="192.662" endTime="193.251">
<Sync time="192.662"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="193.251" endTime="204.042">
<Sync time="193.251"/>
Um... And... And I think being aware of it, and understanding
<Sync time="196.316"/>
the implications of it is and important, very important first step.
<Sync time="199.541"/>
Um... It's also somewhat privildged of me to be able to make that distinction,
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="204.042" endTime="205.543">
<Sync time="204.042"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
and to make that choice
<Who nb="2"/>
Sure...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="205.543" endTime="206.275">
<Sync time="205.543"/>
Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="206.275" endTime="219.799">
<Sync time="206.275"/>
One of the... the interisting things along
<Sync time="208.222"/>
this line that the Deaf culture has done is
<Sync time="211.182"/>
use a lot of um...
<Sync time="213.757"/>
sight, kind of like 
<Sync time="215.623"/>
doing that intensionally. Replacing 
<Sync time="217.853"/>
you know, 'I hear you' with 'I see you'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="219.799" endTime="220.165">
<Sync time="219.799"/>
Um, hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="220.165" endTime="224.606">
<Sync time="220.165"/>
Uh, and in stead of the 'Earth' it's the 'Eyerth'
<Sync time="223.411"/>
so you have E-Y-E-
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="224.606" endTime="225.276">
<Sync time="224.606"/>
Ahhh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="225.276" endTime="226.838">
<Sync time="225.276"/>
R-T-H
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="226.838" endTime="227.833">
<Sync time="226.838"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
stuff like that
<Who nb="2"/>
Sure... Sure...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="227.833" endTime="228.685">
<Sync time="227.833"/>
You have
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="228.685" endTime="229.983">
<Sync time="228.685"/>
Instead of the EARth
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="229.983" endTime="230.653">
<Sync time="229.983"/>
Right...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="230.653" endTime="230.937">
<Sync time="230.653"/>
Yeah...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="230.937" endTime="240.589">
<Sync time="230.937"/>
So... so to sort of 
<Sync time="232.6"/>
to raise 
<Sync time="233.858"/>
awareness of those of how those...
<Sync time="236.777"/>
those un... unseen or unheard 
<Sync time="239.595"/>
useses of language
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="240.589" endTime="241.076">
<Sync time="240.589"/>
Um, hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="241.076" endTime="244.706">
<Sync time="241.076"/>
Um... do shape our thoughts about these issues.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="244.706" endTime="251.275">
<Sync time="244.706"/>
Simmilar... Simmilar to um...
<Sync time="246.774"/>
although some people would find it controversal for some reason, you know, the use of 'herstory'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="251.275" endTime="252.797">
<Sync time="251.275"/>
Right... Right...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="252.797" endTime="262.897">
<Sync time="252.797"/>
As sort of this reawareness situation
<Sync time="256.183"/>
Um... and so I...
<Sync time="258.273"/>
I thank you Vince for... for
<Sync time="260.22"/>
following up and calling us out [chuckles].
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="262.897" endTime="282.468">
<Sync time="262.897"/>
Although I... I [chuckles]
<Sync time="265.028"/>
You bring that up, one of...
<Sync time="266.893"/>
in one of the responses to my essay
<Sync time="269.247"/>
from uhm...
<Sync time="270.829"/>
a fan on Pateron
<Sync time="273.019"/>
she...
<Sync time="274.843"/>
gave a very... very long and well thought out response about
<Sync time="278.129"/>
the use of social justice...
<Sync time="280.42"/>
the use of language in social justice movements,
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="282.468" endTime="282.874">
<Sync time="282.468"/>
Uh huh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="282.874" endTime="306.043">
<Sync time="282.874"/>
and was very against it, even as 
<Sync time="285.369"/>
a feminist using the term 'herstory'.
<Sync time="287.216"/>
She felt that crossed like some line
<Sync time="289.162"/>

<Sync time="289.69"/>

<Sync time="290.645"/>
There's a point to where your
<Sync time="292.571"/>
intentional modification of the linguistic
<Sync time="295.026"/>
norms becomes
<Sync time="296.59"/>
pedantic, or
<Sync time="298.011"/>
like... impractical.
<Sync time="299.959"/>
Right? Or it draws attention to itself
<Sync time="302.189"/>
in a way that's... that's not
<Sync time="303.913"/>
that doesn't benifit your movement
<Sync time="305.657"/>
[chuckles]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="306.043" endTime="310.909">
<Sync time="306.043"/>
And that's... that's something that is... that has long been
<Sync time="309.064"/>
a... a point of contention.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="310.909" endTime="311.497">
<Sync time="310.909"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="311.497" endTime="325.94">
<Sync time="311.497"/>
And I think we gotta always fall back on the complexities.
<Sync time="314.115"/>
You know? This is a complex subject, and one right answer is not the right answer for everybody.
<Sync time="317.421"/>
But, it's the same... it's the same way
<Sync time="319.896"/>
I think in certain ways
<Sync time="321.416"/>
that I've
<Sync time="322.086"/>
I do my absolute best to call this
<Sync time="324.195"/>
streat here in Austin 'guatelupe' [stresses ending ay sound] [TODO: check spelling]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="325.94" endTime="326.631">
<Sync time="325.94"/>
Right...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="326.631" endTime="330.242">
<Sync time="326.631"/>
Um... Because
<Sync time="329.188"/>
there's... there's...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="330.242" endTime="331.036">
<Sync time="330.242"/>
Instead of...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="331.036" endTime="342.014">
<Sync time="331.036"/>
Instead of 'guatelupe' [no ay sound]. Which as any Austin native
<Sync time="333.309"/>
will tell you how that's pronounced.
<Sync time="334.953"/>
And... And it's like well
<Sync time="337.185"/>
[unintellagable] no that's not how it's pronounced... 'Well it is in Austin'
<Sync time="340.163"/>
And it's like 'Well it is when you're white'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="342.014" endTime="343.11">
<Sync time="342.014"/>
Ehhhhh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="343.11" endTime="351.122">
<Sync time="343.11"/>
Um... And... It's a little hipster, it's a little ironic,
<Sync time="346.294"/>
to be calling it that, but
<Sync time="348.098"/>
beyond that, this is how you say that word.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="351.122" endTime="355.117">
<Sync time="351.122"/>
And it is how it is 
<Sync time="353.455"/>
spoken by
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="355.117" endTime="357.691">
<Sync time="355.117"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
the street crossing, Um...
<Who nb="2"/>
[chuckles]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="357.691" endTime="360.367">
<Sync time="357.691"/>
that is set there for the blind like
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="360.367" endTime="360.571">
<Sync time="360.367"/>
Yes
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="360.571" endTime="365.465">
<Sync time="360.571"/>
when it says, you know,
<Sync time="361.463"/>
'Okay to cross... to cross lamar and guatalupe [stress ending ay]'
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="365.465" endTime="365.77">
<Sync time="365.465"/>
Yeah...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="365.77" endTime="374.051">
<Sync time="365.77"/>
Or, You know... they say
<Sync time="367.352"/>
'45th and guatalupe [stress ending ay]'
<Sync time="369.484"/>
So it's like 'Oh, OK. This is clearly what the city
<Sync time="372.631"/>
when they looked into this.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="374.051" endTime="377.359">
<Sync time="374.051"/>
Somebody made that decision.
<Sync time="375.268"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="377.359" endTime="397.224">
<Sync time="377.359"/>
And there's a difference between cutural fun
<Sync time="380.89"/>
and then cutural
<Sync time="382.818"/>
what's the word we've been using a lot of?
<Sync time="386.877"/>
appreciation? appreciation not the... appropriation yeah.
<Sync time="390.387"/>
Which I think we touched on a lot the last episode.
<Sync time="393.937"/>
But...
<Sync time="395.479"/>
Yeah, It's... tricky...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="397.224" endTime="398.543">
<Sync time="397.224"/>
So thank you Vince for...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="398.543" endTime="399.619">
<Sync time="398.543"/>
Yeah... Thank you Vince.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="399.619" endTime="408.895">
<Sync time="399.619"/>
for bringing that up
<Sync time="400.431"/>
And... yeah certianly 
<Sync time="402.258"/>
there's some very deeply 
<Sync time="404.754"/>
ingrained... it's like when we try to do the
<Sync time="407.352"/>
linguistic laberynth, right?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="408.895" endTime="411.087">
<Sync time="408.895"/>
Yeah, it's a little bit like that.
<Sync time="410.154"/>
Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="411.087" endTime="415.291">
<Sync time="411.087"/>
And really, you know, drawing attention to our uses of
<Sync time="413.908"/>
the pronouns, right?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="415.291" endTime="415.778">
<Sync time="415.291"/>
Uh huh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="415.778" endTime="419.35">
<Sync time="415.778"/>
If we were to do a linguistic laberynth we might do one on
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="419.35" endTime="420.75">
<Sync time="419.35"/>
[Laughts]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="420.75" endTime="427.974">
<Sync time="420.75"/>
noticing whenever we use 'I hear you' to mean 'I understand you'.
<Sync time="424.118"/>
Stuff like that. That could be...
<Sync time="425.802"/>
If we keep that rule, in the...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="427.974" endTime="431.201">
<Sync time="427.974"/>
Well, I've got both change and remove
<Sync time="429.983"/>

So we had another, couple other

comments, um. One from squeezie [TODO: SPELLING] who is also...
<Sync time="438.953"/>
He's also plop, I think. He also goes by squeezie, but he says

<Sync time="442.604"/>
"Hey, you didn't kill any people when you did this.

I think that you exadurated

in your pateron post, and I didn't like that idea.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="453.726" endTime="484.064">

I got something along this

response from many people, and I saw this a lot with
<Sync time="461.351"/>
the response from paul and tina
<Sync time="462.777"/>
and to their stuff. It's like 'Hey,
<Sync time="464.604"/>
this isn't that serious...
<Sync time="465.984"/>
You're not killing anyone, right?...
<Sync time="468.439"/>
This is not super... it's not like you're...'
<Sync time="471.381"/>
That kind of deminishes the...
<Sync time="474.972"/>
imporance of it as a moral issue.
<Sync time="478.036"/>
It's like, Yeah there are definately worse things that I
<Sync time="481.181"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="484.064" endTime="488.001">

Right... that is a, what is it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="491.675" endTime="493.238">

It's a type of fallicy. I don't know which kind.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="493.238" endTime="495.916">

It's the slippery slope, I think, or something like that.

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="495.916" endTime="503.909">
<Sync time="495.916"/>
Or the opposite of that.
<Sync time="496.991"/>
It's like 'Oh, well this... there's starving kids in Africa...
<Sync time="501.333"/>
So, why are we worried about, poor people here.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="503.909" endTime="505.106">

First world problems, right?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="505.106" endTime="506.892">

Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="509.064" endTime="531.553">
<Sync time="509.064"/>
Because it's a recignicion... But I think what he...
<Sync time="511.945"/>
what he's doing here is, he's actually drawing attention to something really important,
<Sync time="514.733"/>
which is the idea of scope.
<Sync time="516.762"/>
Right?
<Sync time="517.533"/>
You know...
<Sync time="518.608"/>
One thing that I encountered and I think I talked about this a bit on the youtube response
<Sync time="523.682"/>
It's really tough to
<Sync time="526.157"/>
understand the scope of our actions
<Sync time="529.321"/>
in the networked world now.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="531.553" endTime="532.182">
<Sync time="531.553"/>
Um hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="532.182" endTime="541.639">
<Sync time="532.182"/>
When I was creating my signlanguage videos initially 
<Sync time="536.038"/>
I had a certain scope in mind.
<Sync time="537.581"/>
Right? I'm producing these videos for
<Sync time="539.975"/>
the Jonathan Coulton community
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="541.639" endTime="547.869">
<Sync time="541.639"/>
Right... At the biggest... In other words,
<Sync time="544.946"/>
your friends and people who randomly stumbled upon these things.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="547.869" endTime="586.172">
<Sync time="547.869"/>
Sure, but the structure of YouTube it self
<Sync time="551.158"/>
allows this... allows for rapid and 
<Sync time="555.205"/>
huge changes in scope, given certain other factors.
<Sync time="559.773"/>
So AOL coming in and seeing my videos
<Sync time="561.84"/>
and reposting them in a compleatly different context
<Sync time="565.391"/>
exploded the scope
<Sync time="567.522"/>
and changed a lot of...
<Sync time="569.551"/>
It took this thing that, you know, it made it
<Sync time="573.101"/>
to where I couldn't have
<Sync time="575.252"/>
predicted the
<Sync time="576.754"/>
eventual scope. Right?
<Sync time="579.231"/>
And if I were producing my videos with the idea of
<Sync time="581.727"/>
"This could be seen by every single person on the planet"
<Sync time="584.407"/>
I might not produce anything at all.

Who's onus [TODO: SPELLING] is it on?

and shape their content

for the scopes they anticipate they will reach
<Sync time="610.095"/>
or is it on the onus of someone who

does a very intentional 
<Sync time="615.026"/>
scope expansion

"You guys, touch on punching up,

sticking it to the man, telling truth to power. That kind of stuff.

Vs. punching down, making fun of those beneath you, on the power scale.
<Sync time="708.747"/>
But it seams to me that 
<Sync time="710.755"/>
there is some value in punching down,
<Sync time="713.128"/>
pointing out flaws in those lower on the social scale, that are actually keeping those people down.
<Sync time="717.979"/>
Maybe the Onion is a good example of this,

benifit what punching down means

don't help break down those structures.

Where as punching up typically does
<Sync time="837.105"/>
because those structures are controlled by those in power
<Sync time="839.64"/>
and there's lots of types of power, we've talked about those, 
<Sync time="842.601"/>
It's not just government for example

there's lots of structural powers that exist

the distinction there. I personally can't

there exists somewhere a curve

that fits

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="985.838" endTime="989.347">

Just keep raising the power of the curve

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="994.092" endTime="996.041">
<Sync time="994.092"/>
So in the first one, we started with

<Turn speaker="spk5" startTime="996.041" endTime="998.415">
<Sync time="996.041"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="998.415" endTime="1006.474">
<Sync time="998.415"/>
which is where we discussed 
<Sync time="1000.79"/>
how the Internet effects
<Sync time="1003.266"/>
history
<Sync time="1004.81"/>
and memory and things like that
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1006.474" endTime="1007.448">
<Sync time="1006.474"/>
Oh yeah...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1007.448" endTime="1026.639">
<Sync time="1007.448"/>
And how memory is effected by these things we remember, and these artificial memory aids.
<Sync time="1011.769"/>
Things like time hop and the like.
<Sync time="1013.777"/>
Then we moved on to "The Right to [Redacted]"
<Sync time="1017.509"/>
which was about hiding that history.
<Sync time="1019.457"/>
and sort of removing 
<Sync time="1021.203"/>
that history and is it possible to do so, is it right to do so, should you be allowed to do so.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1026.639" endTime="1027.575">
<Sync time="1026.639"/>
Yeah, Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1027.575" endTime="1039.911">
<Sync time="1027.575"/>
And then we had a sharp right turn, but I'm still gonna make it fit
<Sync time="1031.045"/>
by discussing some of our own Internet history
<Sync time="1033.296"/>
um and these sorts of things. Which I think
<Sync time="1036.055"/>
actually does come into play. 
<Sync time="1037.477"/>
Sort of dealing with the question of, so we've had this revilation [TODO: CONFIRM]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1039.911" endTime="1040.359">
<Sync time="1039.911"/>
Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1040.359" endTime="1048.696">
<Sync time="1040.359"/>
about these videos, and you.
<Sync time="1042.307"/>
I think
<Sync time="1043.727"/>
I'm OK with the decision,
<Sync time="1045.086"/>
decided to leaves these videos up
<Sync time="1046.648"/>
but put disclaimers on them and

<Turn speaker="spk5" startTime="1048.696" endTime="1052.409">
<Sync time="1048.696"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1052.409" endTime="2127.558">
<Sync time="1052.409"/>
this is a bit of a problem, here's why
<Sync time="1055.86"/>
go look at these things, go do this instead.
<Sync time="1057.868"/>
spend your time else where.
<Sync time="1059.491"/>
as sort of a redirect
<Sync time="1061.074"/>
Which is something we didn't really talk about was redirecting history.
