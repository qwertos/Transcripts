um, one of the things that

doesn't quite predate Stephen and my's friendship
<Sync time="63.655"/>
but is almost as old as, our friendship
<Sync time="66.489"/>
um, is Stephen, for what had long time been a hobby, of 
<Sync time="70.844"/>
ASL signed videos. For lack of a better... That's what we're calling it.
<Sync time="74.565"/>
He would, use ASL to present a song,

often from popular culture

[Laughter]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="126.053" endTime="131.056">
<Sync time="126.053"/>
but, yeah, yeah. They linked to you
<Sync time="128.12"/>
and that was big enough that it spread from there.
<Sync time="130.128"/>
Really exciding.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="131.056" endTime="131.449">
<Sync time="131.056"/>
Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="131.449" endTime="145.519">
<Sync time="131.449"/>
Uh, and these songs you did, for, mostly through collage
<Sync time="136.22"/>
and then, kind of, real life got in the way, so you kind of got out of it 
<Sync time="138.845"/>
for a while,
<Sync time="139.775"/>
with occational songs you put back on. And then,
<Sync time="141.677"/>
um, I guess 2 to 3 months ago? 
<Sync time="143.742"/>
Has it only been 2 to three months?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="145.519" endTime="146.676">
<Sync time="145.519"/>
That?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="146.676" endTime="147.999">
<Sync time="146.676"/>
That you created a patreon 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="147.999" endTime="148.764">
<Sync time="147.999"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Yes, yes
<Who nb="2"/>
page
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="148.764" endTime="159.842">
<Sync time="148.764"/>
Uh, so you used
<Sync time="150.15"/>
We've talked about patrieon [TODO: Spelling] on the show 
<Sync time="151.597"/>
and how it's this really neat idea 
<Sync time="152.899"/>
for funding things that are ongoing
<Sync time="155.585"/>
and wouldn't be funded through somthing like Kickstarter
<Sync time="158.106"/>
or potentially any other way at all.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="159.842" endTime="160.359">
<Sync time="159.842"/>
Right
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="160.359" endTime="167.961">
<Sync time="160.359"/>
They didn't have other ways to make money.
<Sync time="162.959"/>
And not even make money persay, like it wasn't about being profitable
<Sync time="165.997"/>
it was about being sustainable.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="167.961" endTime="168.519">
<Sync time="167.961"/>
Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="168.519" endTime="178.517">
<Sync time="168.519"/>
Um... And, so you created a patreon [TODO: Spelling] a few months ago
<Sync time="171.989"/>
for your ASL videos.
<Sync time="173.207"/>
'cause, you know, people have been asking for them to come back.
<Sync time="175.17"/>
Um, and you had 
<Sync time="177.196"/>
always enjoyed it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="178.517" endTime="182.134">
<Sync time="178.517"/>
Well and, the instigation was Polland.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="182.134" endTime="188.42">
<Sync time="182.134"/>
Yes, yes. You went to Polland and performed at a 
<Sync time="185.463"/>
sign language concert?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="188.42" endTime="189.269">
<Sync time="188.42"/>
Yes
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="189.269" endTime="223.604">
<Sync time="189.269"/>
And... Which is still a weird concept to me.
<Sync time="192.098"/>
Um... 
<Sync time="194.042"/>
And that kind of reignited your passion.
<Sync time="196.711"/>
Um, with this performance.
<Sync time="199.764"/>
Um...
<Sync time="201.66"/>
And so, you created this patreon, you were asking for money.
<Sync time="204.532"/>
You were making money. Like, I mean. You were...
<Sync time="206.593"/>
You were able to sustain yourself with this sort of 
<Sync time="209.014"/>
side project.
<Sync time="210.256"/>
It wasn't a full time job. It wasn't going to keep you alive
<Sync time="212.406"/>
Um, but it paid for itself.
<Sync time="213.997"/>
It was definately 
<Sync time="215.609"/>
able to sustain it self to put the 
<Sync time="217.325"/>
time and effort that you needed to put into it.
<Sync time="219.122"/>
to make these... And I will say the quality of them sky rocketed
<Sync time="222.715"/>
You know. If you look at...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="223.604" endTime="224.513">
<Sync time="223.604"/>
Why thank you Kevin.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="224.513" endTime="228.635">
<Sync time="224.513"/>
Um. You look at something you did 
<Sync time="226.487"/>
you know, in front of a bed sheet in your bedroom
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="228.635" endTime="229.152">
<Sync time="228.635"/>
[Laughter]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="229.152" endTime="230.765">
<Sync time="229.152"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
[unintellagable]
<Who nb="2"/>
I did...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="230.765" endTime="233.452">
<Sync time="230.765"/>
I did literally hang bed sheets on the walls
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="233.452" endTime="235.288">
<Sync time="233.452"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Yeah, yeah. Um...
<Who nb="2"/>
for some of these.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="235.288" endTime="242.958">
<Sync time="235.288"/>
Compaired to some of the later ones, which were shot in a studio, with studio
<Sync time="238.142"/>
quality lighting and video,
<Sync time="240.334"/>
um, made a big difference.
<Sync time="241.904"/>
Ah... beer's here.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="242.958" endTime="245.125">
<Sync time="242.958"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
[Celebratory Noises]
<Who nb="2"/>
Yay! Thank you.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="245.125" endTime="254.85">
<Sync time="245.125"/>
And so this created an oppertunity which is what patreon is all about.
<Sync time="250.009"/>
It created a way for you to focus on
<Sync time="253.65"/>
the product first.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="254.85" endTime="255.553">
<Sync time="254.85"/>
Yes
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="255.553" endTime="256.845">
<Sync time="255.553"/>
Um....
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="256.845" endTime="257.754">
<Sync time="256.845"/>
The art.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="257.754" endTime="258.995">
<Sync time="257.754"/>
Well, I intentionally didn't

<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="258.995" endTime="260.174">
<Sync time="258.995"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Okay, okay.
<Who nb="2"/>
use that word.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="260.174" endTime="262.181">
<Sync time="260.174"/>
I've been avoiding that word throughout this entire thing.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="262.181" endTime="262.574">
<Sync time="262.181"/>
Uhhhhhh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="262.574" endTime="264.454">
<Sync time="262.574"/>
Though I think it's a fair discripter.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="264.454" endTime="265.157">
<Sync time="264.454"/>
[chuckles]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="265.157" endTime="268.827">
<Sync time="265.157"/>
Um, I think it is possibly the most fair discripter
<Sync time="268.109"/>
that we could give it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="268.827" endTime="269.548">
<Sync time="268.827"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Okay.
<Who nb="2"/>
but it has a lot of
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="269.548" endTime="271.098">
<Sync time="269.548"/>
contingencies around the
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="271.098" endTime="271.761">
<Sync time="271.098"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
It sure does.
<Who nb="2"/>
termonology.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="271.761" endTime="278.16">
<Sync time="271.761"/>
That's why I was avoiding it.
<Sync time="273.25"/>
Um, but these videos you created,
<Sync time="275.079"/>
which I would,
<Sync time="276.403"/>
without hesitation, would call a peice of art.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="278.16" endTime="278.574">
<Sync time="278.16"/>
Okay
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="278.574" endTime="283.869">
<Sync time="278.574"/>
Um, that doesn't mean
<Sync time="280.994"/>
this other stuff is not at all valid that came up afterwords.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="283.869" endTime="286.056">
<Sync time="283.869"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
So, what happend Kevin?
<Who nb="2"/>
So...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="286.056" endTime="289.982">
<Sync time="286.056"/>
Um, an ASL interperater, not Stephen,
<Sync time="288.578"/>
'cause he's not an ASL interperater.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="289.982" endTime="290.172">
<Sync time="289.982"/>
Nope
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="290.172" endTime="302.387">
<Sync time="290.172"/>
And, you've always been very straight forward about that.
<Sync time="291.456"/>
You're not a CODA. You're not Deaf.
<Sync time="293.255"/>
Um, you have no real connection to the Deaf community.
<Sync time="296.375"/>
Um, which has come up before. I remember you being, kind of, critiqued about that in the past,
<Sync time="301.664"/>
back in college
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="302.387" endTime="303.483">
<Sync time="302.387"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Yeah...
<Who nb="2"/>
people asked you about it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="303.483" endTime="310.941">
<Sync time="303.483"/>
Um, and just kinda handwaved, and goes 'Well ya'know, it's art.'
<Sync time="308.255"/>
Um, and the...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="310.941" endTime="313.836">
<Sync time="310.941"/>
I wasn't asking for money in college, 'cause I was in college
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="313.836" endTime="320.435">
<Sync time="313.836"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
I had, you know the

Yeah, you had money.

<Who nb="2"/>
Yeah, we had
<Sync time="318.325"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
and lighting [unintellagable]. Yeah.
<Who nb="2"/>
ways to succeed.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="320.435" endTime="322.852">
<Sync time="320.435"/>
That's how we recorded how many episodes of Bad Philosophy.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="322.852" endTime="325.602">
<Sync time="322.852"/>
Oh my god. Our audio quality has never been as good
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="325.602" endTime="327.607">
<Sync time="325.602"/>

Never. Never

since. [chuckles]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="327.607" endTime="341.186">
<Sync time="327.607"/>
Um, and so, it was kind of this
<Sync time="331.307"/>
liminal space. It was a hobby. It was sort of his practice.
<Sync time="334.056"/>
And so around the time you started your patreon
<Sync time="337.322"/>
um, unrelated to that,
<Sync time="339.635"/>
Um, I don't know
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="341.186" endTime="342.82">
<Sync time="341.186"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Couple months later... Yeah.
<Who nb="2"/>
how close it was to that. Couple months later
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="342.82" endTime="357.208">
<Sync time="342.82"/>
Alright. I don't know how recent this other stuff was.
<Sync time="344.968"/>
Um, an ASL interperater
<Sync time="346.347"/>
and her husband did
<Sync time="348.375"/>
an ASL song video.
<Sync time="351.086"/>
Um, they interpreted a song or they performed a song
<Sync time="354.599"/>
They played a song and did some ASL along with it
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="357.208" endTime="358.18">

<Who nb="1"/>

in their car.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="358.18" endTime="369.052">
<Sync time="358.18"/>
Um, and it, just like Stephen's "Party in the USA" video
<Sync time="361.898"/>
went viral, became very popular.
<Sync time="364.027"/>
Um, and the two people in the video, who's names I don't remember
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="369.052" endTime="370.169">
<Sync time="369.052"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Paul and Tina.
<Who nb="2"/>
because
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="370.169" endTime="379.43">
<Sync time="370.169"/>
Paul and Tini[sic], looked for a way 
<Sync time="372.918"/>
to capitilize on this
<Sync time="374.551"/>
because that's what you do in our society when things become viral.
<Sync time="377.735"/>
You find a way to capitilize on it.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="379.43" endTime="379.844">

Right

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="379.844" endTime="382.967">

Um, Yeah.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="386.791" endTime="403.396">
<Sync time="386.791"/>
Definately and so they created, as many people do now, a Kickstarter.
<Sync time="390.884"/>
Hey, we're going to raise a whole bunch of money to make a bunch of these videos.
<Sync time="393.984"/>
Um, which
<Sync time="396.137"/>
that's where thing started to become a problem.
<Sync time="399.2"/>
And I say started to become a problem
<Sync time="400.747"/>
that's when we became aware that a problem existed.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="403.396" endTime="404.182">
<Sync time="403.396"/>
Yes
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="404.182" endTime="441.372">
<Sync time="404.182"/>
Um, because the problem didn't just occur because these two people happened.
<Sync time="408.106"/>
Um, and I think it's important. I think it's something you've come to realize
<Sync time="410.818"/>
that's really important.
<Sync time="412.142"/>
Um, the Deaf communtiy was...
<Sync time="415.126"/>
became, up in arms.
<Sync time="416.429"/>
Um, and as we mentioned you've never been considered yourself
<Sync time="418.827"/>
a part of the Deaf community in one way or the other.
<Sync time="420.39"/>
Um, And I know it exists.
<Sync time="423.547"/>
That's about as close as I've ever been personally myself.
<Sync time="425.987"/>
Um, but they...
<Sync time="427.641"/>
They saw this money grab
<Sync time="430.118"/>
based on their culture.
<Sync time="432.385"/>
And their... And their identity.
<Sync time="435.839"/>
Um, and I think we've talked about how language defines identity
<Sync time="439.267"/>
on this show before. If not...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="441.372" endTime="445.129">
<Sync time="441.372"/>
Yeah, we've talked about... Well we've talked about

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="445.129" endTime="446.14">

So, so sure.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="447.152" endTime="451.695">

I'm gonna say language and ident... Language creates identity.

<Who nb="2"/>
Uh, huh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="737.081" endTime="746.652">

and another dimension of this, which is,
<Sync time="739.064"/>
a lot of hearing people coming at it and going 
<Sync time="741.234"/>
"Well, sign language is for everybody, just like all languages are for everybody."
<Sync time="745.515"/>
And...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="746.652" endTime="765.3">
<Sync time="746.652"/>
And, it's a... it's a yes and no.
<Sync time="749.566"/>
Um... and...
<Sync time="751.592"/>
All languages can be for everybody,
<Sync time="755.153"/>
but that doesn't mean
<Sync time="758.418"/>
this language
<Sync time="760.96"/>
isn't also specifically for a specific community and culture.

Um... And... 
<Sync time="773.441"/>
For what it's worth, there has long been

argument and discussion and

people having problems with

translation in any form.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="781.465" endTime="781.796">

You know... And the right way to translate things.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="787.192" endTime="789.796">
<Sync time="787.192"/>
Because, like you said, language is... it defines identity
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="789.796" endTime="791.47">
<Sync time="789.796"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
And... And defines culture.

in a big way
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="791.47" endTime="793.516">

you
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="794.012" endTime="796.657">
<Sync time="794.012"/>
it's part of the transactional nature of...

<Sync time="796.657"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Um, hum...

of...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="797.05" endTime="815.075">
<Sync time="797.05"/>
socialiation of relationship, you know?
<Sync time="800.129"/>
But, cultures transact in many, many ways,
<Sync time="803.148"/>
through sharing, you know, goods through trade, uh...
<Sync time="806.456"/>
cultural... Cultural sharing is another way that...
<Sync time="809.474"/>
that... um... you know? Cultures are both
<Sync time="811.561"/>
diluted but also strangthened
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="815.075" endTime="815.716">

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="815.716" endTime="834.419">

as they may discover aspects of other cultures that can um...
<Sync time="819.105"/>
that can bennifit their own.
<Sync time="821.133"/>
But I think the important
<Sync time="823.241"/>
dynamic here, that not a lot of people were grasping,
<Sync time="826.072"/>
and that I hadn't sufficently grasped,
<Sync time="828.701"/>
is the disparaty in

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="834.419" endTime="834.796">

Uh huh...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="834.796" endTime="838.661">

And I mean...
<Who nb="2"/>
Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="843.146" endTime="846.701">
<Sync time="843.146"/>
It's worth noting, that primarily, we do an audio only podcast.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="846.701" endTime="847.3">

Right.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="847.3" endTime="848.974">

[chuckles]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="848.974" endTime="851.971">

excluding the majority of the deaf community.

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="852.343" endTime="857.242">

Um, which something which actually has been brought to our attention many, many years ago

in which somebody asked us to do transcripts

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="858.422" endTime="864.085">
<Sync time="858.422"/>
And... And...
<Sync time="860.654"/>
I wish we could?
<Sync time="861.977"/>
And then we looked into it, and...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="864.085" endTime="865.738">
<Sync time="864.085"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
It's expensive.

transcription is expensive
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="865.738" endTime="867.143">

and time consuming and hard.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="867.143" endTime="867.811">

Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="867.811" endTime="872.196">
<Sync time="867.811"/>
Which should not be an excuse, but
<Sync time="869.837"/>
this... this, what we are doing here, really truely is a hobby.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="872.196" endTime="872.65">

Yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="872.65" endTime="878.131">

This is something that we are doing, because
<Sync time="874.696"/>
we got together after I got off work and sat down in a bar.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="878.131" endTime="879.906">
<Sync time="878.131"/>
<Who nb="1"/>

Um... So...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="879.906" endTime="884.039">

Um... It would be lovely to have the resources to do that.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="884.039" endTime="884.452">

Right.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="884.452" endTime="887.841">

I mean... God... I just

<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="917.784" endTime="920.286">
<Sync time="917.784"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
Yeah, so... so... we...

the conclusion that I came to and all
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="920.286" endTime="922.559">
<Sync time="920.286"/>
I like how you kind of... You gave yourself three options.

Um hum...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="922.973" endTime="930.89">
<Sync time="922.973"/>
Um, which I think, fairly susently showed up the options that existed.
<Sync time="926.962"/>
Um...
<Sync time="928.162"/>
And I remember the third one,
<Sync time="929.485"/>
'cause, spoiler, that's the one you picked.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="930.89" endTime="931.924">

<Who nb="1"/>

Um... That was the e...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="931.924" endTime="935.688">

That was the one... I could tell,
<Sync time="933.97"/>
with out having to [unintellagable]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="935.688" endTime="936.446">

<Who nb="1"/>
Right... Right...
<Who nb="2"/>
Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="936.446" endTime="941.199">
<Sync time="936.446"/>
Like um... it became very clear to me.
<Sync time="938.326"/>
[unintellagable] you can't say all of this and then...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="941.199" endTime="941.946">
<Sync time="941.199"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
[chuckles]
<Who nb="2"/>
Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="941.946" endTime="950.07">
<Sync time="941.946"/>
So... So... I think the options that existed, you kind of said you could
<Sync time="946.886"/>
Um...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="950.07" endTime="952.081">
<Sync time="950.07"/>

<Who nb="2"/>
Become a part of the community...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="952.081" endTime="958.962">
<Sync time="952.081"/>
So basically, continue doing this,
<Sync time="954.264"/>
but...
<Sync time="955.805"/>
try and...
<Sync time="957.533"/>
remove your privildge from it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="958.962" endTime="962.746">
<Sync time="958.962"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
I think is sort of the way you put it. By becoming a member of that community...
<Who nb="2"/>
Right... Right... Right...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="962.746" endTime="967.399">
<Sync time="962.746"/>
becoming a part of that... and having the community become a part of your creations.

Yes
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="968.143" endTime="977.187">

Um... Thus removing the appropration.
<Sync time="971.102"/>
Um... Making it no longer appropration,
<Sync time="973.375"/>
just doing it [unintellagable].
<Sync time="974.829"/>
Which exists. There are people who do that, you've linked to a bunch of them
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="977.187" endTime="977.684">

Oh yeah
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="977.684" endTime="980.848">
<Sync time="977.684"/>
Um... And... And no one is getting mad about them doing it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1 spk2" startTime="980.848" endTime="985.455">
<Sync time="980.848"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
No, because they grew up in the community.

They're interperters for the community

Yeah

They're a part of that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="987.234" endTime="993.191">
<Sync time="987.234"/>
Well I think the operative term is... and doing that as

the... the driving motivation

for the creation of these

So, yeah. As sort of the driving motivation, and uh...
<Sync time="1004.633"/>
okay so that was one option...
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="1005.916" endTime="1006.97">
<Sync time="1005.916"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
That was an option

stop taking money for it.

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1012.908" endTime="1014.523">
